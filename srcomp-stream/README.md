srcomp-stream
=============

This is a Node application that gives a live stream of events from srcomp.

Configuration occurs via a `config.coffee`, see the `config.coffee.example`
for an example.

Run with `node main.js`.

The output from the stream can be seen via `curl`, for example:
 `curl http://localhost:5001`.
